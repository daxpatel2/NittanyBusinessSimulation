# NittanyBusiness Simulation

This project implements a user login system as part of the Phase 2 Progress Review for CMPSC431W Database Management Systems. It demonstrates how to:

- Connect to a PostgreSQL database using Python (psycopg2)
- Create a table and import data from a CSV file (with securely hashed passwords)
- Build a simple Flask web application that verifies user credentials
- Display login feedback using an HTML dialog

## Overview

The system reads user data from a CSV file (`Users.csv`), hashes each password using SHA256, and stores the data in a PostgreSQL database. A Flask web server then serves a login page where users enter their credentials. The login logic fetches the stored record, compares the hashed password, and returns a message that is displayed in a dialog popup on the page.

## Features

- **Database Connection:** Connects to PostgreSQL using psycopg2.
- **Table Creation:** Automatically creates a `users` table if it does not already exist.
- **Data Import:** Reads and processes a CSV file, hashing passwords before insertion.
- **User Login:** Verifies user credentials against the stored data.
- **Responsive HTML Login Page:** A clean, simple interface with a built-in HTML dialog for user feedback.


## Configuration
Before running the applicaiton, ensure all steps below are completed.

### 1. Downloading Code
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daxpatel2/NittanyBusinessSimulation/
```
Then, navigate to the project folder using:
``` bash
cd NittanyBusinessSimulation
```

### 2. Environment Setup
Install the required Python packages by running:
```bash 
pip install flask psycopg2-binary pandas
```
### 3. Database Credentials 
Open the Python file containing the database connection logic (e.g., `database_queries.py`) and update the `connect()` function with your PostgreSQL credentials. Make sure:

(1) PostgreSQL is running.

(2) The credentials (dbname, user, password, host, port) match your local or remote PostgreSQL server settings.

If you do not already have PostgreSQL downloaded and setup, download it [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Once downloaded, set up an account, then proceed with the above steps.

### 4. CSV Data
Make sure that all CSV files are in the root directory of your project, if not, move them there.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the application and test the system:

### 1. Connect to the Database
To connect to the database (and create it if needed), run the following code:
```python
from database_queries import connect
connect()
```

### 2. Create the Tables
Run the `create_tables()` function once to create all tables:
```python
from database_queries import create_tables
create_tables()
```

### 3. Populate the Tables
After creating the tables, the data needs to be loaded into the tables. For the Users.csv, the system will automatically hash the passwords using SHA-256 before inserting them into the database. To load the data, use the following code:

```python
from database_queries import populate_all_tables
populate_all_tables()
```

### 4. Start the flask server
To launch the login interface, run the Flask application by executing the following command in your terminal from the projectâ€™s root directory:

```bash
python app.py
```

The webpage should be available at:
```cpp
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

If you run into any issues:  
(1) Go back through the confirguration and usage steps.  
(2) Ensure no other service is using port 5000.  
(3) Make sure you are in the same directory as 'app.py'.
